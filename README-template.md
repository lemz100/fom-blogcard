## My process

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


```css
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    background-color: var(--yellow);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 24px;
    font-family: Figtree;
}


Min-height 100vh on body to ensure it takes up full view
Aligned container + attribution using flexbox and space-between to push the attribution to the bottom of the page.
Used a margin on the container div (margin: auto 0) to center the blogcard vertically.

Learnt about the use of line-height and font-weight to add effects to your words.
Learnt of the use of drop-shadow to add shadow effect to elements.

Used figma for the first time:
  Learnt how to see the padding, sizing and other properties of an element using it. 
  Helped me style the card responsively by knowing where to use fixed and responsive sizing.
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on using different font properties to add effects and strenghtening use of Figma to produce design.
I'd also like to strengthen responsive designing
